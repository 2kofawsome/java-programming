Welcome to University of Helsinki’s massive open online course (MOOC) on object-oriented programming!

During this course you will learn all the basics of computer programming, algorithms and object-oriented programming using the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive course materials and plenty of programming exercises, each tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged: the course’s scope and material are identical to our own CS1 programming courses. This first part consists of 7 sets of tasks, corresponding to the 6 weeks of effort in the course taught at our department.

This is the first course in our computer science learning track and we use industry strength tools from day one. Therefore the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) and not in the browser or an educational IDE.
